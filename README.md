# Quiz Game
This quiz game is a simple, yet engaging web-based game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of two HTML pages: the start page and the game page. The design, though straightforward, is appealing, thanks to some basic CSS styling.

The game logic is handled by JavaScript, which pulls questions from a pre-set array and displays them to the user. The user interface offers real-time feedback, with buttons that change color based on the correctness of the user's answer and become disabled when they are not available.

At present, the game contains ten randomized movie-related questions, but there are plans to expand the question set in the future.
